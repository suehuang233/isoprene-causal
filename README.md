# Causal Inference of Urban Isoprene Variability

This repository contains the public release of code accompanying the paper:

> *Causal Inference of Urban Isoprene Variability: Quantifying Environmental Drivers and Future Projections under Warming Climate*  
> (Author: Shu HUANG et al., Year: 2025)

The code provides a minimal and transparent pipeline for estimating **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** and **Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)** of environmental drivers on **isoprene concentrations** using [DoWhy](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy) and [EconML](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML).  
It leverages **Double Machine Learning (CausalForestDML)** with LightGBM base learners and includes hyperparameter tuning.
